#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Haripriya Dhanasekaran is a master’s candidate in Computer Science & Software Engineering at the University of Washington Bothell, where she builds Graph Neural Networks that learn spike-timing data to uncover burst dynamics in large-scale neural recordings. 
Her work sits at the intersection of computational neuroscience, scalable deep learning, and has produced multi-node pipelines that cut data-processing times from hours to minutes. 
Outside the lab, she mentors 80 + students as a Java & Data-Structures teaching assistant.
