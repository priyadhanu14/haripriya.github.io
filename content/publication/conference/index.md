abstract: In recent days, Itâ€™s popularly acknowledged that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to play a major role in influencing a large number of fields and is going to be a major source of automation and innovation. In this review paper, we present an analytical and structured literature review of the current avant-garde of AI in manufacturing and its influence. We particularly analyzed and exemplified papers from a holistic manufacturing perspective. This review provides an overall perspective on how Artificial Intelligence has bolstered Manufacturing domains and how contributions over the years have shaped the role AI has played in manufacturing. AI applications are promising and tend to act as a game-changer in tackling hindrances in metallurgy. Future research can be expected towards developing advanced combined AI applications.
